Assignment Task

We will analyze graduation-related data to determine whether the college is worth the investment. The analysis will help students or job consulting agencies to value the highest return on investment, average salary per major, ethnic, and gender distributions, and so on.

Instructions

First, the original data set surveyed the U.S. recent graduates from 1993 to 2015 every two years. Cleaned up data frame to specific majors which remained consistent from 1995 to 2015. We have columns like Year, Demographics Total, Salary Mean, Salary Median, Salary Quantity, Ethnicity Asian, Ethnicity Minority, Ethnicity White, Male, Female, Bachelor, Doctorate, Masters, and Professional degree.
We used bar charts and line graphs to reveal the differences in average salaries, the disparity between majors with the most and least graduates, the average salary of graduates across different majors, and the distribution of race and gender within the graduating population, among other factors.
We also observed some trends, such as a significant decline in the number of graduates during periods of economic recession or financial crises. This effect is particularly pronounced among white graduates, which may be related to consumer habits. Additionally, the most popular majors with a high number of graduates are not necessarily those with the highest average salaries. On the contrary, graduates from science-related fields, who tend to be fewer in number, generally have higher average salaries compared to those in the humanities.
Declaration

During the project, we used some syntax, formulas, and functions. Some of them are from class, and some of them are from a web search. When we made an error or had no idea what was going on, we discussed or chatted with ChatGPT and got some suggestions or debug for coding. We figured the problem out first and understood it, and then typed the code down. From this view, my work might have some similarities with others.
